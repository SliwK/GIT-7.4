          I found a love for me<br>
          Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead<br>
          I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
          I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br>
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
            Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time<br>
            But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own<br>
            And in your eyes you’re holding mine<br>
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
          Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song<br>
          When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
          But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight<br>
